# ISO2-2023-A02-Testing-P2

## ET.02.03 Second Problem
Write and test the necessary methods to calculate the roots of the quadratic equation. In 
addition to the subsequent semantic considerations of the problem, also take into account the 
following:
* The user interface will be through the command line. Classes with specific methods for 
reading from the keyboard and writing strings and numbers to the screen must be 
developed.
* Use exceptions at those points in the program where it is necessary to control the 
program flow.
* Do not couple domain classes with the user interface (e.g., do not generate screen 
outputs in domain logic classes).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can create an executable `jar` with `mvn package`. It will be located in `Testing-P2>Application>target>Application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` and you can execute it in your terminal with `java -jar Application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## How to publish your reports

* Note for the testers:

In the `docs` folder I generated a `javadoc` for the Quadratic Equation just to fill the [repository website](https://lucia-martin17.github.io/ISO2-2023-A02-Testing-P2), so when you generate the report's `.html` files please, overwrite the `docs` folder with that, it should generate an `index.html` file.
